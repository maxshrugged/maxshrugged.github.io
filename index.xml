      <description>Hi! My name is Max and I have a career in tech. But finance and investing have always been my passion. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot on the topic learned a lot nearly enough to understand how to consistently earn money in the stock market.
Take everything you read here as Max personal opinions. I might retain the positions in the securities discussed or be flat out wrong. None of this is a trading advice and should not be relied on for any decisions.</description>
